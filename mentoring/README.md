# Kubernetes Mentoring Programs

This page indexes all of the mentoring initiatives for contributing to the Kubernetes project. For end user mentoring initiatives, check out KubeCon and other CNCF events and programs.

---

We understand that everyone has different learning styles and we want to support
as many of those as possible. Mentoring is vital to the growth of an individual
and organization of every kind. For Kubernetes, the larger the project becomes,
it's necessary to keep a continuous pipeline of quality contributors and we want you to hang around!


## Current mentoring activities:

### SIG's office hours 
- [Office hours](/mentoring/programs/office-hours.md)

### Long Term Contributor Ladder Growth (currently in planning, expected later this year)
- [Group Mentoring Cohorts](/mentoring/mentors/group-mentoring.md)


External programs
- [LFX Mentorship](/mentoring/processes/lfx-mentorship.md)

- [Apache Mentoring Programme](https://community.apache.org/mentoringprogramme.html)
- [exercism.io](https://github.com/OperationCode/exercism-io-mentoring)

- [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/)
- [OpenStack Mentoring](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mentoring)

Thanks to:

- the many contributors who reviewed and participated in brainstorming,
- founding mentees for their willingness to try this out,
- founding mentors (@chrislovecnm, @luxas, @kow3ns, @nikhita)

We welcome PRs, suggestions, and help!
