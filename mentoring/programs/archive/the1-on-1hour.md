The 1:1 Hour
=======
This is a work in progress. Please follow along to our issues in kubernetes/community with the tag `area/mentorship-planning`. The details of this planning can be seen the issue [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2657).

## One Mentor. One Mentee. One Hour

In this mentorship opportunity, you'll be paired with someone in the ecosystem that can help drive your upstream Kubernetes experience forward with a quick burst of information. The mentee controls the content that will be served during that hour. This is open for new AND current contributors of all [levels](/community-membership.md).

Activities that you can select from include:
* Pair programming
* Live code review how-to (for those wishing to be a reviewer or be a better reviewer)
* Live docs review how-to
* Live code review of a proposed solution you are working on
* Codebase tour of a certain area
* Guidance on your contributor path (advice on becoming an approver, etc.)
* AMA session (ask anything!)

We will attempt to match you with the closest mentor of your area of interested or activity.
